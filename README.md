## 🎯 Goal

To demonstrate how **Neural Networks + Symbolic AI** can work together to:

- Reduce hallucination
- Improve logical consistency
- Enable context-aware moderation and classification
- Support explainable AI decisions

## 🧩 Example Use Case

If a video contains:
- **Extreme visual content**
- **Calm, scientific narration**
- **Valid medical or educational references**

Then the system can:
- Contextualize the extremity
- Whitelist the content
- Allow monetization or safe distribution

## 📂 Project Structure

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project is a **conceptual and architectural prototype**.

- Neural models are represented as modular placeholders
- Real-world deployment would require:
  - Trained vision/audio/OCR models
  - Verified medical knowledge databases
  - Scalable inference infrastructure

---

## 🤖 Development Note

This project was built as a **personal exploration** using **AI-assisted coding** combined with original system design and reasoning decisions.
